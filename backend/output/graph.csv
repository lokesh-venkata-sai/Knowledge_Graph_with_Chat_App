margin stacking|xilinx's prices|Since Xilinx has to pay TSMC for chips, and then add their own margin to the price, there are two companies worth of margins in Xilinx’s prices. However, with Altera and Intel becoming one company after Intel acquired Altera, they don't have two companies’ worth of margins to deal with, and they could potentially drop prices.|394805b316ab4def9f052981f317312e

intel|dram business|Invented commercial DRAMs and brought in so much revenue that Intel founders Gordon Moore and Andy Grove were quite skeptical of the microprocessor’s importance to the company. However, the Intel 8088 microprocessor’s success in the IBM PC market coupled with fierce Japanese competition in the DRAM arena caused Moore and Grove to pivot in 1985. That year, Intel dumped its DRAM business and became the microprocessor company we know today.|2b2a6d5788e945deb2b69980150e6313
